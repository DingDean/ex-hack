# Logo

You can edit the logo by opening the ex-hack-logo-src.svg file using the
[inkscape](https://inkscape.org) image editor.

When saving the source file, please use the "Inkscape SVG" format to keep all
the editing-related meta-data.

When saving the actual logo, use the "simple SVG" format to remove all the
unnecessary stuff.
